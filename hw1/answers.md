HW 1
=======
 
Question 1.1
-----------
The DOM is a model of the structure of a document, which is made up of different objects.  
This DOM can be generated by languages like HTML and generated/modified with Javascript.  
Therefore the HTML and Javascript source code containts the routines that generate and modify the DOM. The DOM-Inspector shows the current state of the DOM, once it has been created and modified.  
The DOM is useful for debugging the HTML code and understanding what has been generated. It can also be useful to quickly try out changes (i.e. trying out diffent font colors)  
The HTML source is useful to create permanent and repeatable routines that generate or modify the DOM.


Question 1.2
-----------
The table is written in markup. Thus the html table is generated by a markup to html converter.  
The data is stored inline in the answers.md file. #ASK TF > DO THEY MEAN THIS?


Question 2.1
-----------
No, I would not filter other columns in the same way.  
gdp, life expectancy and population I would filter using a range widget that allows to specify bottom and lower numerical limits.  
Year I would filter using a range or dropdown widget.  
Name I would filter using a dropdown widget that allows to select all countries starting with a specific letter (e.g "A")
